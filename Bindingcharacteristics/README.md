# Peakfeatures_graphs.Rmd

Simple code to visualise differences in avg peak width and area covered under peaks for different DNA-binding proteins (Bacterial NAPs vs TFs vs Halophilic histones vs Halophilic TFs). The input to this is Table S3 of the paper (also uploaded here). Information within this table was obtained from peak lists generated by Mosaics (as shown in the Peakcalling subfolder), with elementary processing in order to get peak width and total bases covered done within Excel. The number of bases covered was then expressed as a percentage of the total size of the genome to get a comparable number of coverage across species. This code uses simple ggplot2 commands to generate graphs from this data.

Input dependency: TableS3_peakcharacteristics.xlsx

Library depepdency: ggplot2_3.3.5 readxl_1.3.1

# Annotatepeaksandclassify.Rmd:

This is a modified version of code written by Rylee Hackley and Amy Schmid.

Takes a peak list; annotates each peak with the nearest feature (promoter or gene), and thus classifies each peak as belonging to coding or promoter regions. Further details are included within the code itself.

# Peaklocationplots.Rmd

Simple code that generates bar plots from information about whether peaks are coding or intergenic.

That information is generated from the code above (Annotatepeaksandclassify.Rmd) for multiple proteins (including HstA, HpyA, other halophilic TFs). The output is stored in Peaklocations.xlsx (which is the only Input dependency)
