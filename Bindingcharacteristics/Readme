Annotatepeaksandclassify.Rmd:
This is a modified version of code written by Rylee Hackley and Amy Schmid.
Takes a peak list; annotates each peak with the nearest feature (promoter or gene), and thus classifies each peak as belonging to coding or promoter regions.
Further details are included within the code itself.
